## **Practica 1 web design applications**
This first practice was done in order to practice the basic knowledge learned in class about HTML and CSS.
We created a webpage as a presentation, with our information, such as name, biography, and interests.

## **How it was done:**
1: The index HTML file was created, and in the body, the Header, Main, and Footer sections were included. The requested information was added to each section. In addition to the background color, a design was used where each photo served as the background image, adding an image scroll effect.

2: CSS was used to style the page, setting the background color of the page and the font styles.
